Redacted
Aiden Kimball and Zane Wallace

In our game “Redacted” you play as a Russian spy the United States government caught after an incident. 
While they do not have enough information to punish you, they will try their best to come up with tricky questions to try and catch you. 
In the game you can either tell the truth on a question, making it easier to answer, or try and tell a lie.
However, if you give away too many truths the interrogator will be able to catch you, ending your run.
When the answers are given, the interrogator checks to see if the answers match up with previous responses. 
For example, if the interrogator asks “Do you know Victor Pavlov?” and you reply with “No” then the next time the interrogator asks “Do you know Victor Pavlov?” 
you must say “No” to not be caught which will lead to ending your run.
